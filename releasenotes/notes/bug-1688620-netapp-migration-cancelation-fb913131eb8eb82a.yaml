    NetApp cDOT driver with a very busy backend may report that the
    ``migration cancelation`` operation was successful even if wasn't. Now
    during the ``migration cancelation`` operation the current state of the
    migration task will be tracked and the operation will only report success
    when the operation ends correctly.
